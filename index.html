      <h3>Putting in Work</h3>
    </header> 
    <p>At this point in my life I am extremely close to entering the professional realm of society. I currently
	have one semester left at IIT until graduation, where my focuses revolve around Engineering Management [
	Mechanical Eng.] and Information Security. Every time I say that it becomes more much apparent how little
	time there is separating me from that milestone. The people that I have chosen to surround myself with these
	past few years have shown me one very important thing, networking is "Golden". Even though I've stretched
	myself quite thin at times I can proudly say that being on the Executive Board for four, going on five, 
	organizations on campus and taking classes in almost every college you'd frequently hear about at IIT, 
	has given me a more vivid picture of the immediate environment surrounding my life. In simpler words,
	I'm a cool dude and I gravitate towards all the other cool people no matter where I find myself. The final
	decision on whether or not I should find myself a second Minor or take a shot at a Master's is still up 
	in the air, but I shall decide soon enough. But until then I will keep striving forward and put in "Work" 
	like mama told me.</p>

      <h3>My Interests</h3>
    </header>  
    <p>This is quite an expansive topic but to make things clear I'll use some of the html code that has graced
	my skill set.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anime</li>
      <li>Coding</li>
      <li>Cars & Auto Racing</li>
      <li>Exercise/Health</li>
      <li>Fashion</li>
      <li>Investing</li>
      <li>Engineering</li>
      <li>Pets</li>
      <li>Personal Finance</li>
      <li>Cooking</li>
      <li>Languages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I would like to say that I haven't fully incorporated all of these into my life yet; there are still a few 
	that will take a bit more time to fully set in, but good change comes to those who are patient [and diligent].</p>
