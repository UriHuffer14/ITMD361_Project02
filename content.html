      <h3>What content do I cover?</h3>
    </header>
    <p>At this point in time I make  YouTube videos and stream on Twitch. Many of the games that I cover are
	console games but there are quite a few PC ones as well. Recently I've been able to acquire some extra 
	hardware that'll improve the quality of my content and that should hopefully show this semester. On top 
	of having a YT channel I would like to add a serious blog that will follow the hobbies that I've listed 
	above. Also, casual vlogs will correspond to the interests listed on the main page and general events 
	or updates that are relevant. </p>

      <h3>Future Goals</h3>
    </header> 
    <p>My short-term goals include setting up a concrete schedule for my content creation. If you have checked
	out my site you'll see that a large number of those "cool things" don't have a single video uploaded. So
	that will be a major list item to accomplish and I will need to create some custom banners with Gimp, as 
	well as an intro video because those are <strong>important!</strong></p>
    <p>If anyone would like to assist me on my journey or find yourselves having something in common after 
	skimming through, please feel free to contact me @</p>
    <p>lhuff1@hawk.iit.edu | I will eventually add some social media stuff here too ^_^</p>
